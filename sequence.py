# 1. Get how long the sequence is from the user
# 2. Realise that the sequence doesn't work for a(0),a(1) and a(2), so let a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2 and a(2) = 3
# 3. Implement the sequence a(n) = a(n-1)*2 - (n-3)  i.e: a(4) = a(3)*2 - (4-3) = 6*2 - 1 = 11
# 4. print each number of the sequence with a "," inbetween

n = int(input("Enter the length of the sequence: ")) # Do not change this line
